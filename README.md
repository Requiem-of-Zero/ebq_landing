#NOTES TO SELF:
Challenges: -Creating responsive design for the first time
            -Filter box shadow for marketing dept PNG (getting a box shadow for the area around the content dimensions)

Learned:  -Easier to create responsive design before UI/UX for desktops
          -Fixed pixels causes issues for responsiveness
          -Filter box shadows that works for PNGs (really cool)
          -For HTML semantics, ids are used for one offs/specifics, while classes should be used much more often.
